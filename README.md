# Ready for the Stage - Theatre Inserts Extension

## Features

  - **Characters Ready for the Stage.** When a player connects who has a character set to their User, that actor will be automatically added to the Theatre Inserts bar
  - **Simplified Settings.** Peruse your way over to the Ready For Stage module settings to find some simplified settings used to modify some Theatre Inserts settings in ways I find nicely usable
  - **New Hotkeys.** Peruse the Ready For Stage controls settings to see the full list of new functions, but I'll go over Relevant Hotkeys on the next page
    - **Quick Toggle Selected Token to Stage.** This is the magic button to interact with this helper in the best way.
      - While you have tokens selected will toggle them in and out of Theatre Inserts
      - Additionally if you are a player and have no tokens selected it will toggle your user's Character in and out of Theatre Inserts.
      - Additionally if you select a token is a currently active user's Character it will add them to their stage thus allowing them to nudge and flip it themselves
    - **Clear Your Stage.** Clears your stage of actors
    - **Clear All Stages.** _GM Only_ Clears all stage of actors
  - **PF2e Specific Selectors.** Updates Theatre Inserts settings to automatically hid PF2e Persistent HUD when you have the Theatre Inserts setting on to suppress HUD.
